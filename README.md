# You're gonna 7 me 4 this

A linear multiply accumlate based hash is malleable under not so strict circumstances. The data to be modified needs a following scratch space, where the ripples of the modification can be dumped. As far as I know AES-GCM's Galois hash is just like this - the only difference is that the MAC is over Galois field. Although the subkey H is necessarily needed to perform this, the endpoints of the communication both know H, and if the second endpoint can establish a new connection with a third one so that H stays the same, then the second can froward the modified message of the first node so, that its signature of the AES-GCM key stays valid...
